> “oh ok, that sounds cool, BUT... does it mean I need to throw away everything I've learned in all those years programming in [insert your preferable non-fp oriented programming language] if I want to dive into fp?”

---

no, you do not! however, since most of us are used to imperative programming, you would need to refactor your knowledge, so it could fit the fp way!

---

# this slide should talk about what you can "save" from imperative programming and which new skills you need to develop

---

# functional programming's most primitive principles:

- pure functions
- immutability

---

# pure functions

## this slide should have the nazare's meme

---

# yep, that's exactly what it is looking like: math time!

## _what on earth this pure function thing has to do with math???_

## _SPOILER ALERT_

## EVERYTHING!

---

# first of all, let's talk about what is considered a function in the awesome math world

## a function is nothing more than a relation between two conjuntos numéricos, where one cojunto is mapped to the other one

### however, this mapping has to follow some basic rules

---

# a given input will alawys return the same output (draw a vann diagram somehow to explain this)

---

# (I need to remember if there is any other rule hahaha)

---

# (this should contain some code comparing impure and pure functions)

```jsx
<div>hey there!</div>
```

---

# (talk about typed languages and use the elephant example)

---

# (start talking about immutability)

---

# (some code using map, filter and reduce)

---

# (talk about immutability x performance)

## (also maybe talk about the tree thing that reutilize nodes to save cpu/ram usage)

---

# (discuss about JS as a fp capable language)
